## Applicative order vs normal order

- Fully expand then reduce is called normal order
- Operate then substitute with abstracted function is applicative order
- Lisp uses applicative order evaluation. Additional efficiency obtained from avoiding multiple evaluation of expressions.
- Normal order eval becomes much more complex

## conditional predicates
<, =, >, and, or, not

## Linear Recursion and Iteration

fermat's little theorem
- if n is a prime number and a is any positive integer less than n, then a raised to the nth power is congruent to a modulo n

congruent modulo n if they both have the same remainder when divided by n.

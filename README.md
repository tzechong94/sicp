## Applicative order vs normal order

- Fully expand then reduce is called normal order
- Operate then substitute with abstracted function is applicative order
- Lisp uses applicative order evaluation. Additional efficiency obtained from avoiding multiple evaluation of expressions.
- Normal order eval becomes much more complex

## conditional predicates
<, =, >, and, or, not
